    <p>Built by the first Portuguese Viceroy in India, Don Francesco de Almeida (1505), St. Angeloâ€™s Fort is among the most historic sites in Kannur. This massive triangular laterite structure is flanked by gigantic bastions that make for an imposing sight. It changed hands between the Dutch and eventually the British, who would remodel and reequip it into their primary military stronghold in Malabar.
       Mopilla Bay and Dharamadam Island are among the primary attractions here. Mopilla Bay is a natural harbour and the fort offers a wonderful view of it along with a sea wall projecting from the fort separating the rough sea and inland water.  Dharamadam Island, barely 5 acres in area, is 100 m from the mainland and a favourite haunt of tourists. People come to the fort for relaxing strolls and just a brilliant view of the Arabian Sea.

    At a distance of 2 km from Kannur Railway Station, Kannur Lighthouse is a lighthouse situated near Payyambalam Beach in Kannur town of Kerala. Adjacent to the Sea View Park and the Government Guest House, it is the fourth largest lighthouse in Kerala and one of the popular Kannur Tourist Places.
Also known as Cannanore Lighthouse, the lighthouse is still active and overlooks the Arabian Sea. In 1843, the British introduced a system of hoisting a lantern with an oil wick lamp in order to warn ships. A masonry pedestal was constructed in 1903 on the rampart of Kannur fort and placed a double wick oil lamp inside the 4th order dioptric lens and lantern on this pedestal. The light was made available during fair seasons only, from September to May every year. In 1939, the light was shifted on to a 16-metre steel trestle erected on the northern bastion of the fort. In 1948, the system was replaced by a flashing light which uses Dissolved Acetylene gas as fuel.
